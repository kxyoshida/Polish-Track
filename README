28 March 2012: 
- This program is obsolete. Use Polish-Track-COM instead.
- This program often fails to fit, producing results with the centre located in the edge of the region but still tagged as "successful fitting = 1". The "single spot" version of this program, "Polish-Spot-Location" has been just fixed to exclude these failures, but this obsolte program remains yet to be fixed.
